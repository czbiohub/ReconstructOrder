# ReconstructOrder
Reconstruct birefringence, slow axis, bright-field, and degree of polarization from polarization images acquired with 
Micro-Manager and OpenPolScope acquisition plugin.

## Getting Started

### Install through pip install 

### Install through git clone 
First, git clone the repository to your home directory by doing:

```buildoutcfg
git clone https://github.com/czbiohub/ReconstructOrder.git
```
 
If you are running ReconstructOrder on your own machine, install the python library dependency by:

```buildoutcfg
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you are running ReconstructOrder on a compute node (e.g., fry2@czbiohub), it is recommended to run it in 
a Docker container. 
Docker is the virtual environment with all the required libraries pre-installed so you can run your copy of 
ReconstructOrder without recreating the environment.
The docker image for ReconstructOrder has been built on fry2@czbiohub. 
If you are running ReconstructOrder on other servers, you can build the docker image after cloning the repository 
by doing :    

```buildoutcfg
docker build -t reconstruct_order:py37 -f Dockerfile.ReconstructOrder .
```

Now, to start a docker container, do 
```buildoutcfg
docker run -it  -v /data/<your data dir>/:<data dir name inside docker>/ -v ~/ReconstructOrder:/ReconstructOrder reconstruct_order:py37 bash
```
### Run reconstruction
To run reconstruction, go to ReconstructOrder repository directory (e.g. /ReconstructOrder) and do
```buildoutcfg
python runReconstruction.py --config <your config file>.yml
```

See /ReconstructOrder/config/config_example.yml for an example config file and explanation of parameters.
